  <p>Domine is a slab serif typeface designed by Pablo Impallari in 2012. It was released as open-source and is freely available on Google Fonts. The design features teardrop terminals and feels almost like a cross between Clarendon and ITC Clearface. Domine was created with longform reading on the web in mind, however, it currently lacks italics so it works best as a display face or possibly for small amounts of body copy where italics might not be needed.</p>

    <p>From the very first steps in the design process ‘Domine’ was designed, tested and optimized for body text on the web. It shines at 14 and 16 px. And can even be used as small as 11, 12 or 13px.
  Harmless to the eyes when reading long texts.</p>

  <p> It’s is friendly in appearance because it combines the classic elements of familiar typefaces that have been in use from more than 100 years like Clarendon, Century, Cheltenham and Clearface.</p><br>
